### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 2 was and is still a favorite of mine because we finally got to create programs with colors!!! As this was the last lab of our class, it had incoporated many features of c++. I had prior experience with colors/images but it was not with the language c++. Lab 12 part-2 is of an animated gif. The background is of fully generated random colors and will always be switching colors. It is sort of like static with old tvs in which programs werent available in a channel, except there is color in it. Many funny tv shows use this method actually, though I am pretty sure they just animate it rather than write code.

* Lab 11
    
    Lab 11 part-2 was a project of mine in which I used fundamentals of object oriented programming to create a program of the game Hi-Lo. The game asks for the users guess and if they guessed the secret number correctly, they win, otherwise, they are told whether they guessed too high or too low and wil receive minus 1 guess. I have always been fascinated with random numbers and finally understanding how computer scientists create codes that incorporate randomness is sort of a relief.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 part-2 was a project in which we used modular programming. We used several files, each with different purposes to complete a program. Each file would use other files in the header, including them. The program itself would tell you the population of a county in California that you would type. If you didnt type in a proper county, an error message would appear and the program would give you a list of all counties in California.
